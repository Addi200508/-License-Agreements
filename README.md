# License Agreements on Chain

## 📄 Project Description

**License Agreements on Chain** is a decentralized application that allows licensors to create and store software license agreements directly on the blockchain. This ensures transparency, authenticity, and immutability of licensing data while enabling licensees to verify the validity of their agreements anytime.

## 🌍 Project Vision

The project aims to provide a secure and trustless system for managing digital license agreements using smart contracts. By moving license issuance and storage onto the blockchain, the project reduces reliance on intermediaries and minimizes the risk of data tampering or disputes.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Immutable License Storage**: License agreements are stored permanently on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized Verification**: Anyone can verify a license's existence and timestamp.
- **Licensor-Only Control**: Only the licensor can issue agreements, ensuring authorized creation.

## 🔭 Future Scope

- **Revocable or Upgradable Licenses**: Enable license revocation or updates with versioning.
- **Multi-Party Agreements**: Support for agreements involving multiple parties or roles.
- **NFT-Based Licensing**: Represent licenses as tradable NFTs with metadata.
- **Legal Compliance Layer**: Integration with jurisdictions for enforceability in legal systems.
- **Web3 UI Integration**: Build a front-end to allow users to interact with the smart contract via MetaMask or WalletConnect.
